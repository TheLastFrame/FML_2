ToDos:

- [ ] Business/Data Understanding
- [ ] Data Prep - Lisa
  - [x] cleaning e.g. unnecessary columns (or which would be problematic for ethics & data privacy)
  - [ ] test model performance with all columns available?
  - [ ] feature engineering?
  - [x] create centralized test set of all - Fabian
  - [x] create seed for val set for reproducability
  - [x] create data_prep.py (library, auch f√ºr einzel Daten f√ºr deployment?)
  - [ ] Optimize Models?
- [ ] Logistic Regression Training - Daniel
  - [x] Centralized - Fabian
  - [x] Individual for each Bank (for comparison to FML)
  - [ ] (Optional) Federated - Fabian (SVC is better Model, but only slightly)
  - [ ] Explainability
- [ ] SVM Training - Daniel 
  - [x] Centralized - Fabian
  - [x] Individual for each Bank (for comparison to FML)
  - [ ] Federated - Fabian
  - [ ] Explainability
- [ ] NN Model Training (TensorFlow) - Vanessa
  - [x] Centralized
  - [x] Individual for each Bank (for comparison to FML) - Fabian
  - [x] Optimize - hat Vanessa gut gemacht üòâ
  - [x] Federated - Fabian
  - [ ] Explainability
- [ ] (Optional) Connection to W&B (upload stats)
  - [ ] Explainability
  - [ ] Performance
  - [ ] Eval Accuracy
- [ ] (Optional) Streamlit/Gradio Test Interface f√ºr Model = **Deployment**?
- [ ] Code Cleaning
- [ ] Security issues?!
- [ ] Model Card?
- [ ] Pr√§sentation (ans CRISP-DM anpassen)
  - [x] Results of Business/Data Understanding
  - [x] Results of Feature Engineering
  - [ ] FL Model Performance (Centralized vs. FML vs 3x NN)
  - [x] Comparison to centralized Model (per bank?)
  - [x] Comparison to simpler non-NN Model_(s) (performance & acc)
  - [ ] Performance Criteria (Precision?)
  - [ ] Fairness & Explainability
  - [x] Security issues?!
  - [ ] Model Card?


Thoughts:
Compare sperately trained Bank Performance with Federated Performance (Global & bank specific data) = What could single bank achieve vs FML?
Compare centrtal model to FML?

Thursday ToDos:
- [x] Centralized NN (Track?)
    - [x] inference time per element = 707us/step
    - [x] eval per bank data
- [x] 3 seperate NN per bank
- [ ] Logistic Regression 
    - [x] inference time per element 
- [x] NN Explainability
- [ ] (Optional) Model Cards
